# Blocking: Do DivII teams block to much?

Blocking point losses due to waterfalls, deflections, enabling re-attacks, etc.

## Test: Outcomes from blocks touched vs blocks missed.

Based on whether a block made contact, measured
probability of block scoring a point or enabling a counter attack.

Results:

- Advantage gained from touched blocks:  44%  (223 / 522)
- Advantage gained from missed blocks:   48%  (299 / 522)


## Test: Outcomes from variable number of blockers.

Measured probability of block producing a positive outcome based on number of blockers.

Results:

- Advantage gained from 0 blockers:  70%   ( 97 /  139)
- Advantage gained from 1 blocker:   47%   (191 /  407)
- Advantage gained from 2 blockers:  52%   (570 / 1100)
- Advantage gained from 3 blockers:  54%   (  7 /   13)

Comments:

- 70% for 0 blockers mostly due to an identified weak hit and blockers pull off.
- Only 5% gain from going from 1 to 2 blockers.  Is it worth it?


### Possible strategies:

- No blocking on backrow attacks.
- Reduced blockers on a out-of-system set from middle to back row.
- Reduced blockers on a bad pass or if a non-setter is setting.
- Only 1 blocker on tight sets where blocker can easily get their hands around the ball.
- No blockers after a certain point in a long volley.

### Questions:

- Outcomes of blocks with side deflections vs. deflections over the top?
- Blocking to pass vs. blocking to block?


# Slide Hitting

Pull shot slide: A slide hit off of a back shooting set.  Similar to a foosball pull shot
with the same advantages:  Hitter has a window where they can choose where to hit.


## Effectiveness of various types of hits.

Measured probability of scoring from different types of hits.

Results:

- Backrow    : Score%:  9.4% (  5 /  53)  Hit%:  5.8% ( 53 / 911) 
- Right side : Score%: 32.0% ( 39 / 122)  Hit%: 13.4% (122 / 911) 
- Left side  : Score%: 26.0% (102 / 392)  Hit%: 43.0% (392 / 911) 
- One        : Score%: 33.6% ( 36 / 107)  Hit%: 11.7% (107 / 911) 
- Two        : Score%: 37.1% ( 43 / 116)  Hit%: 12.7% (116 / 911) 
- Slide      : Score%: 43.0% ( 52 / 121)  Hit%: 13.3% (121 / 911)

Comments:

- Wow, slide at 43%.
- Left side has high totals and low score % because it is the default for out-of-system play.
    - Is there better alternative for out-of-system?  
- A 2 is more effective than a 1?

If slides are really that effective, is it possible to design a slide centric offense?
