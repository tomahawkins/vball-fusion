# Unconventional Volleyball Strategies with Analysis and Verification

This is a collection of unconventional volleyball theories for
various strategies and tactics, loosely backed with some analysis and
suggested tests for verification.
In all likelyhood, these theories are wrong.
Yet maybe there are one or two jems in here that can break new ground.

The target level of play is NCAA Women's Division II.

# Theory: Sliding Pull Shot (from Foosball)

Idea is borrowed from the foosball [pull shot](http://www.foosballsoccer.com/pull-shot.html).
Setter sets a back 31 for a slide.  Hitter runs parallel to the net with
the ball and has a window along net that she can choose to hit,
potentially enabling her to selectively hit around the block.

Blockers will have a hard time judging where to block.
Watching the hitters body won't give much indication of when they are going to leave the ground.
To guage where the shot is going to be,
an effective blocker has to watch the hitter's feet and the ball at the same time.

Lefthanded hitters could run a pull shot on the left side.


# Theory: Attack in 2 is undervalued.

A free ball sent to the front of the court provides excellent
opporunity to launch a hitting attack in 2 touches.  Though setter dumps are
common, an opposing team is almost never expecting a strong hit on the
second touch.  The passer simply needs to place the ball at the net to an awaiting hitter.
Unfortunately when this opporunity presents itself, this tactic is rarely employeed.

- Link to Russian setter attack vs Brasil in olympics.


# Theory: Blocking to pass vs. blocking to block.  Blocking to pass yields better outcomes.

- Blocks that deflect sideways vs off the top are more detrimental.
- Pushing (penetrating net) increases likelyhood of waterfall.
- Goal is to:
  - use the block as an extra pass
  - provide a controlled, energy absorbing deflection to defenders
  - protect the middle court
- Angle arms and hand back to deflect ball up, not down.
- Net penetration is not critical, less jumping energy expended by blockers.
  - Lower jumps may reduce touch out of bounds.
- Analysis: Outcomes of side deflects vs over top deflects.
- Combined blocking to pass with attack-in-2.


# Theory: All quick set offense.

What happens if offense almost always sets quick:  31 outside, 1 middle, sliding pull shot on the right.


# Theory: Sets from backrow (result of a bad pass) do not justify full complement of blockers (3).

# Theory: When the ball is set tight, 1 blocker is more effective than 2.
